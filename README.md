# Laptiop/Desktop Application- "Pin-PinðŸ“Œ"

A pop-up tool designed for multitaskers who need to pin reference or immediate content. Built using SwiftUI, Figma, Adobe, Git, and Xcode, the app features a one-time tutorial, a drag-and-drop interface, and persistent media between tabs. Users can toggle between two tabs, each with a dedicated overlay zone for dropping media. Images and videos adjust to a fixed display area, and the app remains visible across spaces and full-screen apps unless closed or minimized manually.
